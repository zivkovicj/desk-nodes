  Create scores upon creating a topic

✓ Add more students and topics so that the algo has more to work with
✓ Separate Scoresheet Button and Desk Constultants Button

Consultants algo: 
  Choose topics
    ✓In order of topic priority
    ✓Choose enough consultants for each topic to match need / 4
    ✓ Allocate remaining students into those groups
    ✓ Allocate the students more evenly (maybe use groups as the outer loop.  Repeat the process four times.)
  Dry the code that fetches all the data
  ✓ Display results
    ✓ Arrange students into clusters of four
    ✓ Highlight consultant student

Finish student routes
  ✓ Post
  ✓ Put
  ✓ Delete

✓ Put a little more work into the appearance of the score table

✓ Scoresheet is editable to change the scores

✓ Connect desk-consultants page to database scores instead of fake scores.





Future To-Dos
  Give user an announcement upon adding, updating, or deleting a student
  Don't assign consultants who scored above 90 unless we must
  Maybe one more pass for consultants who scored 100
  Allocate students who have scored high in everything
