Ask if anybody is willing to swap code reviews

Make a ranked list of several good candidates.  Include LinkedIn and Indeed.  Re-watch the video that included other tips.

NEAR FUTURE
***********************************

Establish a way to reset the database

I think that I may have fixed the problem where many scores don't show up when the user relods the scoresheet.  But pay attention to whether it acutally fixed.
Consider looking again at some async and await articles for a more efficient way to do this.  Or asking on StackOverflow.

Authentication

Clear out groups that only ended up with one student, then re-assign them.
Notes about why some students ended up with the new topic.

Attendance-marking page before DC results.

Organize students, scores, and topics in their own router page.

Re-route upon deleting a student

Don't allow scores below 0 or over 100

Finish topic routes
  Post
  Put
  Delete
  Create scores upon creating a topic

Implement tests


***********************************
FAR FUTURE
***********************************

  Give user an announcement upon adding, updating, or deleting a student
  Don't assign consultants who scored above 90 unless we must
  Maybe one more pass for consultants who scored 100
  Allocate students who have scored high in everything

  If this ever gets used in a classroom again, make sure to implement a system to keep track of which students need a turn to be consultant.

  ✓ Display results
    ✓ Arrange students into clusters of four
    ✓ Highlight consultant student
