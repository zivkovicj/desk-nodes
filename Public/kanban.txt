Roadmap for Desk Nodes

***********************************
BEFORE I BEGIN APPLYING FOR JOBS
***********************************

Include all new scores when re-loading page

Link to homepage from
  scores
  DC
  students view

Place students whose scores were too high to place them.

Ask if anybody is willing to swap code reviews

Main portfolio page that links to this and other projects.
  Iron Maiden front-end

Make a ranked list of several good candidates.  Include LinkedIn and Indeed.  Re-watch the video that included other tips.


***********************************
NEAR FUTURE
***********************************



Authentication

Clear out groups that only ended up with one student, then re-assign them.
Notes about why some students ended up with the new topic.

Attendance-marking page before DC results.

Organize students, scores, and topics in their own router page.

Re-route upon deleting a student

Finish topic routes
  Post
  Put
  Delete
  Create scores upon creating a topic


***********************************
FAR FUTURE
***********************************

  Give user an announcement upon adding, updating, or deleting a student
  Don't assign consultants who scored above 90 unless we must
  Maybe one more pass for consultants who scored 100
  Allocate students who have scored high in everything



✓ Add more students and topics so that the algo has more to work with
✓ Separate Scoresheet Button and Desk Constultants Button

Consultants algo: 
  Choose topics
    ✓In order of topic priority
    ✓Choose enough consultants for each topic to match need / 4
    ✓ Allocate remaining students into those groups
    ✓ Allocate the students more evenly (maybe use groups as the outer loop.  Repeat the process four times.)
  Dry the code that fetches all the data
  ✓ Display results
    ✓ Arrange students into clusters of four
    ✓ Highlight consultant student

Finish student routes
  ✓ Post
  ✓ Put
  ✓ Delete

✓ Put a little more work into the appearance of the score table

✓ Scoresheet is editable to change the scores

✓ Connect desk-consultants page to database scores instead of fake scores.

✓  Bug: Can't set scores to 0 or blank (Because it requires an integer)
